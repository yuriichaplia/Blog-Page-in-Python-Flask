# Blog Page

This is a simple Python Flask webpage application that works as a blog page where the information is obtained using an API.  
The website has been created using **HTML** and **CSS**, while the backend part uses **Flask**.

#### You may replace the information on the blog page with your own using [API NPoint IO](https://www.npoint.io/).  
The structure of the JSON bin should be:

```text
[] JSON
 {} 0 
    + id : 1 
    + body : "some text here" 
    + title : "some text here"
    + subtitle : "text here"
 
 {} 1 
    + id : 2 
    + body : "text here" 
    + title : "some text here"
    + subtitle : "text here"
